# Read me first

Git and GitHub are great tools for programmers and software developers to use. When installing and working with Git and GitHub, people often encounter various difficulties and the difficulties are different from one scenario to another. The purpose of this project is to collect mini-tutorials that explain how to make Git and GitHub work in different application scenarios.

## Suggested layout of mini-tutorials

To be consistent, each mini-tutorial should begin with an explanation of the application scenario, including the OS and programming or software development environment being used, and how Git and GitHub are used for the project(s).

The main part of the tutorial should be to explain how to make Git and GitHub work for the purpose(S). Please try to show clearly the steps taken to make Git and GitHub work.

The next section should be pointing out the possible problems one may have and solutions to the problems.

## Languages used to write the mini-tutorials

To ensure the mini-tutorials are more accessbile, the mini-tutorials should be written in Markdown, HTML, Word or PDF, all without macros or scripts for security reasons.

Thank you!
